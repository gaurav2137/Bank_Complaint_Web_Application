      " In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a loan modification for the mortgage on my home that I have lived in for 22 years. It was a principal and interest only loan, with my monthly payment totaling {$440.00}. The loan was made possible by extending the years on my previous mortgage, which thereby lowered my payments. The interest rate was fixed for a 30-year term. In order to be accepted for this modification, I had to go through a 3 month trial period to ensure full payments of {$440.00} were made by the first of each month. I met this requirement and therefore, my mortgage payment stayed at the rate of {$440.00} for the remainder ofthe loan. I knew that this was a principal and interest loan, and that I was responsible for paying real estate taxes and home owner 's insurance, as was directed on the signed contract. I continued to pay my taxes and home insurance and am current on all payments up to this date, XX/XX/19. \n",

They said that they had mistakenly not included escrow in the modification from XX/XX/XXXX and  therefore, owed this amount. But, I had paid the town of XXXX, MA for all the real estate taxed owed as well as paid my home owner 's insurance. I tried to set up an escrow account with CCO mortgage from that date forward, and provided them with proof of all the last year 's taxes and insurance payments. They did not agree to this. I have made several attempts to resolve this issue and am still paying real estate taxes and home owner 's insurance, as well as my {$440.00} monthly mortgage payment. CCO Mortgage claims that they have been paying the real estate taxes and insurance, and now say I owe them thousands of dollars, as this issue has gone back and forth for the past few years with no resolution. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have provided to CCO mortgage all documentation and proof of taxes and insurance payments, and can still provide this documentation, if needed. At this time, they are threatening foreclosure, though I've continued to make timely payments. I appreciate receiving the modification, which allows me to stay in my home, and just wish to resolve this issue as prorrptly as possible.\n"
